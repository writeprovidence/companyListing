# vestbanking
To further our commitment to delivering superior value all year round, sponsors can now vest their funds with Farmsponsor! With VestBanking: Sponsors can add more value to their sponsorship by keeping their funds with us until a new sponsoring window opens! Sponsors can now participate in the future sponsoring windows in advance, on time and before the units sell out. The interest rate on your vestbanking account balance is 1.25% per month and interest accrues daily! Minimum Vest Banking amount is 1,000 Naira but only a minimum of 1 unit (ie. 100,000 Naira) can be used to sponsor local farmers in Farmsponsor sponsoring windows.
